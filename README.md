## Description

This project is an **Dart** + **Flutter** application to relax little old kids with relaxing sounds, internet radio stations, with personal recordings or draw their attention with animations.

### Functions

- Listen to relaxing sounds from an audio playlist
- Listen to internet radio stations
- Record your own audios for later listening
- Entertain the little ones with animations and upload your own (.gif)
- New experimental feature that can be enabled when you are viewing an animation. The idea is to measure the sound while the animation is still playing, and if the child makes a lot of noise (like crying or something like that) the animation dims and is barely displayed, while if he stops making noise the animation is displayed correctly again, with the idea that the child associates stopping making noise with watching the animation.
- Add gifs you have on your phone in the animations section or add videos to a list (for example from Youtube) for direct and faster access.
